<hr>
<p>Antarctica does not contain any sovereign nations within it, because of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS).</p>
<p>Some countries have Antarctic territory claims but they are not allowed to mine, or build any large infrastructure that would be disruptive to the landscape.</p>
<p>The only infrastructure in Antarctica is multiple scientific research bases, owned by many different countries across the globe.</p>
<p>The USA and Russia are the only two nations that are allowed to claim territory on Antacrtica if they decide to.</p>
<p>This means that the ATS renders Antarctica the world's largest nature reserve, as countries with territorial claims are not allowed to expand their claims in any way.</p>
<p>Marie Byrd Land is the only area of Antarctica unclaimed by any nation.</p>
